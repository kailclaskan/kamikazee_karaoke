1. Transfer Kamikazee Karaoke excel file to Table in Database called Songs.
    a. Verify all songs in songs.xlsx
    b. Verify all rows exist:
        -Song Title
            *Confirmed Column A
        -Artist
            *Confirmed Column B
        -Favorite
            *Confirmed Column C (Removed, this will be in a table that connects a user to the song they favorited.)
        -Genre
            *Confirmed Column C
        -Year
            *Confirmed Column D
    c. Convert to Table in Database kamikazeekaraoke
        -Need to set up a seed file so all of this is prepped and just needs to be added.
            *Refer to other backends.
    d. Be sure this is in the correct location.
        -Should be in the Backend file.
    e. Seed Database and fill the empty genre and year columns.
        -Could create an app that uses the iTunes api to get the year/genre of the song based on song name and filtered by artist. Requires a database and express to run, but would be a one time use.
        -Could make it read from a txt file of the songName and artistName. Still would query the iTunes api to get it.
            -> Both solutions would update the Database with this information. 
            -> Either way would need to create a seed file to start the Database.
                => IF I'm able to update the current database I can figure out a way to export the data to a sql seed.
